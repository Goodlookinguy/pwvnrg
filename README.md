### Should always be activated (even if you activate nothing else)
0. Global Fixes

### Proper Activation Order
Pick a style, then follow each list indent to activate a theme to look as it was designed.

Example: To activate Pro Blue. Activate 'Grayscale'. Then activate 'Pro Blue'.
Example 2: To activate VA Eclipse. Activate 'Grayscale'. Then activate 'Colorful Addon'. Lastly activate 'VA Eclipse'.

For proper looks, addons are optional unless the theme is listed under it, like 'VA Eclipse' and 'The Blues'. If using
addons that are not considered to be needed for proper look, ensure you activate it at the level of activation before
activating the rest of the indented list.

Example: To have VA Eclipse with Compact Addon. Activate 'Grayscale' -> Activate 'Colorful Addon' -> Activate 'Compact Addon' -> Activate 'VA Eclipse'
